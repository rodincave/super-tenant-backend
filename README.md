# 🏡 Tenant Finder

A hackathon project designed to help property owners **quickly evaluate candidates** and **select the best tenants** based on customized criteria.

Our intelligent agent-based system automates the screening process, giving property owners more confidence and speed in their rental decisions.

## 🔄 How It Works — At a Glance
The process starts with just a link to your property listing. From there, everything is automated:

🏠 You upload a listing link (e.g., from Airbnb, Idealista, etc.)

🤖 We scrape property info and generate an agent for your property

📞 You receive a phone number – candidates call in and leave voice messages

🧠 Agents evaluate the calls using LLMs and voice-to-text + scoring logic

✅ Useful candidates are approved automatically

🥇 Best candidates are ranked and suggested

📅 You can directly book visits with the best ones
